title: Novel Magnetorheological Fluids Project
--- 

### Motivation 

I began this project in May of 2019, and almost its entirity has been motivated by my own curiosity first and foremost. However, as I began to uncover more about the nature of magnetorheological fluids (MRFs), I learned about the plethora of useful and important applications for these fluids, which further contributed to the motivation for this project. These applications will be discussed in the sections that follow, but I figured that I should address why this project has come to fruition and why it is an important topic to study.

I had originally began this project as an investigation of shear-thickening non-Newtonian fluids, a class of smart fluids that increase their viscosity, or thickeness, in response to an applied force or field.
