title: Novel Magnetorheological Fluids Project
--- 

### Motivation 

I began this project in May of 2019, and almost its entirity has been motivated by my own curiosity first and foremost. However, as I began to uncover more about the nature of magnetorheological fluids (MRFs), I learned about the plethora of useful and important applications for these fluids, which further contributed to the motivation for this project. These applications will be discussed in the sections that follow, but I figured that I should address why this project has come to fruition and why it is an important topic to study.

I had originally began this project as an investigation of shear-thickening non-Newtonian fluids, a class of smart fluids that increase their viscosity, or thickeness, in response to an applied force or field.

As depicted in Figure 1, when a shear stress is applied to the fluid, structural changes occur within the molecules suspended in the fluid medium, in this case hydroclusters, that cause them to act like a solid or semi-solid. I found this incredibly fascinating when I first saw these fluids, as it reminded me of the Michael Criton novel Prey, in which nano-robitic creatures act under a horde mindset and accomplish seemingly impossible tasks, as if the fluid itself had a mind of its own. Luckily enough, after sending a variety of emails to professors at Caltech and Harvey Mudd College (and after a series of rejections), one professor, Professor Mark Ilton at Harvey Mudd, very graciously agreed to mentor me in this project, his exprtise being primarily centered around soft matter materials.

At this point, I had a general topic of study and an expert to aid me, which had me thrilled beyond what I can express here. It has been my dream to be a scientific researcher sicne kindergarten, and that dream was at least partially coming to fruition. Now, I had the significantly harder, yet more exciting, portion of my work: setting a narrow topic of focus and generating a method to test an idea within that topic. 

At this point, my childish excitement became a hinderance. It prevented me from being entirely rational in my search for a gap in the literature. It prodded me to latch onto what I thought were original ideas without thouroughly checking the literature. It became the small child running around in a lab coat, one with ambition and curiostity, but one with naviety running through its veins. 

Metaphors aside, my naviety got the best of me in the early stages of my research. Around September of 2019, I became extremely interested in high speed cameras, and I thought that examining various non-newtonian fluids and their behavior in extreme detail could yield some interesting results. Two major problems arose
